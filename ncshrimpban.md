## 要約

漁業種保全のための規制が、沿岸漁業者の意見を分け、対立を生んでいる。

規制賛成派は、規制は重要な魚種の減少を食い止めるものと考えているが、反対派は規制案は意図した効果をもたらさず、沿岸漁業に壊滅的な影響をもたらすものだと考えている。

### The fish that arent here anymore

トム・ローラーは釣りガイド。オオニベやオキスズキ、サワラなどをつらせるが、最も重要な魚種はヒラメである。「昔はよく釣れたが今はほとんど見なくなった。乱獲の末、何も対策をしなったツケがこうなっている」と述べる。

ヒラメの遊漁は、ヒラメ漁業管理計画の漁獲枠が上限に達したため、今年いっぱいは禁漁であり、商業漁業の水揚量も過去２０年間で８８％減少した。

更に、河口域で産卵する海産魚の水揚量も同様な傾向を見せており、オキスズキで７８％、スポットクローカー（ニベ類）で９４％、タイセイヨウイシモチで８５％の減少が報告されている。

ルイス・ダニエル（現ノースカロライナ野生動物連合、元ノースカロライナ州環境局海洋漁業部長）は、これらの漁獲減は河口域の生育場におけるエビ漁業の影響だと語る。

河口域で産卵する魚種の多くは、成長のために沖の餌場へと渡るが、成熟前にパムリコ湾でエビトロールや刺し網によって混獲される（パムリコ湾はノースカロライナ州最大のエビ漁業海域）。推定では約５００ｇのエビを漁獲するために、４倍の２ｋｇ近くの混獲が発生していると考えられている。

ノースカロライナ州は北部メリーランドから南部テキサスまでの州で、唯一稚魚生育場でのトロールが行われており、漁獲死亡率は非常に高いと考えられ、対策がない状態では魚資源の枯渇の危険性がある。

ダニエル「これはまさに共有地の悲劇だ。まさにお手本のような悲劇だ」

### Legislativ fishing Proposal
これらの問題に対応するため、NCWFが法案を作成し、2019年春に下院へ提出し可決、2020年には上院で議論されることになった。CCANC（Coastal Conservation Association of North Calorina, ノースカロライナ州沿岸保全協会）は、沿岸域でのエビトロール漁業は過去数十年にわたる問題であり、他州では禁止されているか制限されている漁業だと表し、過去にノースカロライナ州でも議論され法律が1997年に施行されているが、改正を行うべきだと述べた。2017年に同法律の改正を求める運動が発生したが失敗したが、今年は別の法案として提案し、75%成熟体長未満を若魚とし以下の漁獲を禁じるものとした。

### Commercial opposition

2018年には約4400トンのえびが漁獲され、21億円規模の漁業となっており、同州のや漁業の約1/4を占めている。

According to the N.C. Fisheries Association, the state has one of the nation’s “most rigorous legal and regulatory” management systems. The web of regulations, the association said, “stymies growth and creates unnecessary barriers.”

In September, Brent Fulcher, a fourth-generation shrimper spoke to CPP during a break from guiding tours during the N.C. Seafood Festival in Morehead City aboard his fishing vessel, the Micah Bell.

Fulcher is the chairman of the board of directors of the N.C. Fisheries Association Inc. and operates a fleet of 10 shrimp boats and two commercial seafood operations in Craven and Carteret counties. His businesses employ 40 and support roughly 200-300 independent commercial fishermen.

“I don’t think Let Em Spawn is the right way to manage (the fishery),” he said.

“We’re the ones that put in the two-day conservation limit. We are the ones that went to the drawing board and figured out how to limit some areas.

“If you look at a fisherman being a farmer of the sea, he’s got to make sure he’s doing certain things to promote growth for the next year. We rotate out of certain fisheries to allow that resource to be sustainable. There are so many things that this industry does that people don’t realize.”

According to a document published by the NCFA, “Shrimp By-Catch: Bridging the Gap” written by Beaufort attorney Steven L. Weeks Sr., nearly 1 million acres of internal coastal waters are closed to trawling, just under half of the total coastal waters. In addition, it is estimated that only 10%-15% of coastal waters are trawled. In all, the document claims that survival rates of fish captured in shrimp trawls is 22%-48%.

During a tour, Fulcher demonstrated the operation of a “fish excluder device”, one of several bycatch reduction devices aboard the Micah Bell. The FED allows bycatch to escape through an opening in the net. The use of the devices are required by the N.C. Division of Marine Fisheries. Testing in 2015 showed reductions of bycatch up to 38 percent, according to the NCFA.

Daniel, of the N.C. Wildlife Federation, is skeptical. He explained to CPP that in the1970s, ’80s, and ’90s, the capacity of the commercial fishing fleet increased due to better engines, navigational tools and stronger, cheaper netting.

“The impression is that once a juvenile fish gets shot from the net, it grows up and spawns, but what happens is that 20 minutes later another trawler comes along,” he said.

“What they refuse to acknowledge is that the number of fish that survive an individual tow is meaningless. What is meaningful is what leaves the inlet and goes offshore and contributes to the population.”

### Overseeing marine fisheries
The agency that manages North Carolina’s coastal fisheries said that the efforts of commercial fishermen to reduce bycatch have been meaningful.

In North Carolina, coastal fisheries are managed by the Division of Marine Fisheries of the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality.

Kathy Rawls, chief of the Fisheries Management Section of the DMF, doesn’t dispute that North Carolina allows more fishing techniques than other states but said the compositions of the state’s estuaries and fisheries are not comparable to other states. The Pamlico Sound, for example, is the largest estuarine system along the Eastern Seaboard.

She also said that gill netting, while banned in other states, is “highly regulated” in North Carolina. Gill nets aren’t “necessarily as harmful as they are made out to be” if used appropriately, Rawls said.

“Shrimp trawl bycatch is something the division works on and has made huge improvements over the last several years and will be a huge part of future management plans,” she said.

Rawls also does not dispute that shrimp trawling has an impact on populations of fish caught; however, “the state looks at things other than just landings to determine the population status” of various fish. “It’s difficult to put a number on what level of bycatch is out there and what effect it has on some of these populations.” For example, she said, croaker have “such a high mortality rate as juveniles that it’s hard to put a number on it.”

Her primary concern with the Let ‘Em Spawn bill is the “across the board” application of the bill’s proposed size limit, L75.

“There are so many things that go into selecting the most appropriate size limit, but it is not just a sweeping broad brush that is L75. I don’t know of any other fishery management entity that manages fish in that way,” she said. “Right tool, just the wrong method.”

Daniel of the N.C. Wildlife Federation disagrees.

“Many (states) use size limits at or near the size at maturity,” he said.

“That’s the point. Many use L100, which means all fish have reached the size they spawn. Others use L50, which is the size in which half of them spawn. The L75 is a compromise between the two. HB483 is very specific to species where an L75 or a slot limit is appropriate.”

### An emotional issue
Proponents of Let ‘Em Spawn have attempted to work with commercial fishermen, Sneed said.

However, members of the commercial fishing industry “want the status quo,” he said.

“They feel that if they give up one thing, they will take it all, but the science is there to show the stocks are declining and their industry will kill itself if they don’t start to realize that things need to change.”

Chris Horton, the fisheries program director of the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, said that, despite the drop in the population of Southern flounder and other species, “they can recover over time, but the science says we need to reduce the harvest because how we’ve been managing appears to not be working.”

The Washington, D.C.-based organization works with state legislatures to advance the interests of hunters and anglers and supports HB483.

Horton concedes, however, that regulating fisheries is an emotional issue.

“For recreational charter fishermen and commercial fishermen, this is their livelihood,” he said.

Nevertheless, he said he’s worried that North Carolina’s method of managing fish leaves it ripe for its politics to supersede the science.

“As a legislator representing a coastal community, you want to represent your constituents, but at the same time, we’ve got to look at the bigger picture to maintain the fisheries over the long term,” Horton said.

Indeed, advocates may have a tough time capturing support from coastal legislators when the Senate hears the bill next year.

The Let Em Spawn bill was co-sponsored by Reps. Larry Yarborough, R-Granville, Jason Saine, R-Lincoln, Michael Wray, D-Halifax, and Brian Turner, D-Buncombe, all representing inland districts, but was supported by just one coastal lawmaker, Rep. Holly Grange, R-New Hanover.

The state is managing fisheries “as well or better than any other state in the U.S.,” Fulcher said.

“You need to let the state manage the fishery the way it’s intended to be managed and not by the General Assembly. Let ’Em Spawn is a way to circumvent the state. You manage it by the science, and that is what we’re all following.”

“For commercial and recreational fisherman, Let ‘Em Spawn will be devastating,” he said. “My business directly and indirectly supports 250-300 people. Let ’Em spawn would cause most of that to be gone.”
